# parachuteAlg
Calculus II problem solved with a computer algorithm

The problem was basically this: Jane is a secret agent and is being chased. Her plane has been shot down and she needs to determine when to pull her parachute to a) survive the fall and b) spend the least bit of time in the air to allow her the most time to escape. In order to survive her landing, her falling velocity could be at most 9.5 meters per second.

This program calculated falling velocity and attempted different times (t) during the fall to pull the chute. Each iteration would check that landing speed was safe and that the iteration's total fall time was better then the previous (initial time set to 999).
